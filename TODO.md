# Immediate actions

1. Add logic for INSERT INTO in execute tree
2. Write about the progress so far, so people can learn from it

# Next steps

* Separate it into client/server architecture
* Stress test the INSERT INTO
* Provide a simple distributed architecture to learn a bit about distributed systems
* Implement SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE
* Provide sane error handling
