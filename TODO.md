# Immediate actions

1. Make INSERT INTO respect the schema
2. Add logic for INSERT INTO in execute tree
3. Write about the progress so far, so people can learn from it

# Next steps

* Separate it into client/server architecture
* Stress test the INSERT INTO
* Provide a simple distributed architecture to learn a bit about distributed systems
* Implement SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE
